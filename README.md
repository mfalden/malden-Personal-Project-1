# Project Proposal
High Score Tracker
[ ] List: txt w/ all current scores
[ ] Player input: name and score
[ ] Loop: checking if player score is highest score 
    - If yes, display "You have the highest score!" or something. 
    - If not, display a consolation message based on the score's position in the overall list of scores (?) 
    - If letters in score, say "invalid input" 


## Overview
My program's purpose is to be a high score tracker. It takes the player's input and compares the player's high score to other high scores inputted, and based on the score displays "You have the high score!" or "You do not have the high score!". It then displays the list of scores from highest score to lowest score. The scores are stored in a text file.
